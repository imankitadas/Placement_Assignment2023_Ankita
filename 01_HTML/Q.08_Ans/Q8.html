// Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

// Solution--->

The <img> tag is used specifically for embedding  images in an HTML document.It does not contain content or captions directly related to the image.
It has attribute like 'src' (source), 'alt' (alternative text), 'width' , height to define image properties.

The <figure> tag is used to group together an image and it's related to content such as captions.It is useful when you want to associate a caption with an image, diagram or similar content.
